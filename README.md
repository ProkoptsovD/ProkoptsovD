### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Dmytro Prokoptsov!

---
Hope you've had your coffee already. If not, I'll keep this short. I'm HUSBAND, FATHER and MIDDLE FRONTEND DEVELOPER in 3 years. Though I've just started my journey, I am deeply in love with all that magic JS, CSS and HTML can do. Also I fond of leanrnig some new stuff: listen to astronomical podcasts all the time, watch videos about software development on YouTube either. 
---
My current toolbox which is obviously pint-sized:
*HTML;
*CSS;
*SASS.

What else... well, I repair my car all the time :) and fill free to contact me, if you wanna leave a feedback or wanna help me gain some experience.
